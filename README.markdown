A clone of the game chips challenge using the [ActionKid](https://github.com/egonSchiele/actionkid) game framework.

**Demo video**: http://vimeo.com/109613639

## Controls

- `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` keys: move
- `space`: god mode
- `n`: jump to next level
- `p`: jump to previous level
- `r`: restart level

## Download

[Download the binary for OS X x86_64 here](http://static.adit.io/chips.zip)

I haven't been able to get this packaged as a mac app, so you it is just the binary. **You will have to run it from the command line**. If you can help package it as a mac app, or build a binary for a different platform, please open a pull request!

## If the game freezes on OS X

Disable "Automatic GPU Switching" in System Preferences / Energy Saver.
